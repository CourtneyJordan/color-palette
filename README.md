###Color Palette v1.0 Bubblicious

Color Palette is a project inspired from a previous version of ![Twitter Bootstrap](http://bootstrapdocs.com/v2.0.0/docs/less.html#variables "Twitter Bootstrapp 2.0.0") (2.0.0). Websites should have set guidelines as to a color scheme from buttons to linked text. These guidelines will prevent multiple color usage on various elements which could cause accessbility issues along with confussion.
